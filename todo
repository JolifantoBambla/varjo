* work out if we have to support parameter qualifiers (in out for 
   funcs)...cant see why we would - WE WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS


;;------------------------------------------------------

* ternary ? must be special function - 
* pipe | can't be a symbol in common lisp...why
* no way to do modf...not lispt either...except with values
* glsl-defun doesnt use the arg names we give it

* create built in vars that are structs
* make * work- it is currently very wrong
* make / work
* add copy-ob function
* add place flag to code-ob
* add out-vars to code-b
* add invarient flag to code-ob
* write melm for varjo
* write type casting functions
* write if if-else and switch code
* create for and while loops - note break and continue
* work out how return will work
* this will probably help with discard
* add last few built-in functions
* add all the texture lookup functions
* add lisp macros wrappers for this functionality
* find out what the fuck centroid means
* read up on setting variables as invariant
* out vars need to propergate as lists so they can be passed to
  other shaders
* remove second type component... it is irrelevant

* add preprocessor extensions to translate function
* check out _line_ _file_ and _version_ macros from glsl, are they
 used?
