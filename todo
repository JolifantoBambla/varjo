* need a way to specify other details like *layout-size*

* fragment in-cars can have qualifiers

* add all the texture lookup functions
* read up on setting variables as invariant
* find out what the fuck centroid means
* fix read-only

* add lambda?
* add preprocessor extensions to translate function
* check out _line_ _file_ and _version_ macros from glsl, are they
  used?
* add lisp macros wrappers for this functionality
* Massive cleanup of code
* glsl-defun doesnt use the arg names we give it

-----------------------------------------------------

* labels appends it's functions (obviously dangerous)
* progn indenting ""
* We dont check for collisions between in-vars and in-built
  for example: (defshader :!test! ((color :vec4)) color)
