* read up on setting variables as invariant
* find out what the fuck centroid means

* add preprocessor extensions to translate function
* check out _line_ _file_ and _version_ macros from glsl, are they
  used?
* add lisp macros wrappers for this functionality
* Massive cleanup of code
* glsl-defun doesnt use the arg names we give it

-----------------------------------------------------

* Need to support nested structures for uniforms
* out vars could legitimately have the same name if they
  are used inside an if statement.
* if one not present, should auto-add return statement to functions

* Where does the vec b go?
(varjo:defshader? test ((a :int) (b :sampler-1d))
   (texture-size b a))

* is code-read-only neccesary? we use var -spec to set place to nil
  to stop assignment
