* read up on setting variables as invariant
* find out what the fuck centroid means

* add preprocessor extensions to translate function
* check out _line_ _file_ and _version_ macros from glsl, are they
  used?
* add lisp macros wrappers for this functionality
* Massive cleanup of code
* glsl-defun doesnt use the arg names we give it

* add decent swizzle function

-----------------------------------------------------

* Need to support nested structures for uniforms

* define proper conditionals and use them in our errors

* imported struct has incorrect case info

* smooth out not becoming smooth in

* float * vec4 = float?

* add constants

* add versions requirements to all functions (eek!)

* how do we handle ARBs?

* Keep glsl-defuns as spec but used compiled list for initializing. Should be faster.

* remove all funcs from compatibility profile, we should be enforcing new style to as early
  a version of glsl as possible. We need to have :context-restriction for built in vars

* Need to change name of substitution to macro

* change substitution to have :context-restriction
