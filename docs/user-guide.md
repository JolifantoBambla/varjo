# Varjo

Varjo is a compiler that compiles a dialect of lisp called Vari to GLSL

## Vari

Vari is a statically typed dialect of lisp. It attempts to stick as closely as possible to Common Lisp except for places where the abstraction would be misleading (usually in terms of performance) to the user.
